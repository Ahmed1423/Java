The decimal number system represents numbers using ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It is also known as the base-10 system, meaning each digit in a number has a place value that is a power of 10.

Example:
The number 125 can be broken down as:
1 × 10^2 + 2 × 10^1 + 5 × 10^0
This gives us:
1 × 100 + 2 × 10 + 5 × 1 = 125.

In this example, the position of each digit determines its place value:

- The 1 is in the hundreds place (1 × 100),
- The 2 is in the tens place (2 × 10),
- The 5 is in the ones place (5 × 1).
