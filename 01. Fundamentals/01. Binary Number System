The binary number system represents numbers using two digits: 0, 1. It is also known as the base-2 system, meaning each digit in a number has a place value that is a power of 2.

Example:
The number 6 can be broken down as:
1 × 2 ^ 2 + 1 × 2 ^ 1 + 0 × 2 ^ 0
This gives us: 1 × 4 + 1 × 2 + 0 × 1 = 6

In this example, the position of each digit determines its place value:

- The 1 is in the 2^2 place (1 × 4),
- The 1 is in the 2^1 place (1 × 2),
- The 0 is in the 2^0 place (0 × 1).
