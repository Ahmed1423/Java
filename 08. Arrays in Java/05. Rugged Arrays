Rugged Arrays:

In Java there is nothing called as multi dimensional arrays, so what we have is array of arrays. 

We could have rows with same or varying columns:

int[] nums = new int[3][];

for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
  nums[i] = new int[i + 1];
}

Only for structure, values should be initialized.
{
  {1}, 
  {2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6}
}
