An Array is a collection of similar elements stored in contiguos memory locations. The index values starts from 0. 

It is a data structure that allow random access of the data with the help of indexes. 

Example 1: [1, 2, 3, 4] -> array of integers
Example 2: ["abcd", "efgh", "hijk", "lmno"] -> array of strings
Example 3: [1.0f, 2.2f, 3.3f, 4.4f] -> array of floats

In order to access first element of the array:

name_of_array[0] -> 1 for integers, "abcd" for strings, "1.0" for floats

You can have an array of size 0. 

Default value for integer arrays would be 0. 
Default value for string arrays would be null.
Default value for boolean arrays would be false.
