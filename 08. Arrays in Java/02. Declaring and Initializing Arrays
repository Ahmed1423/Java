Declaration:

int[] nums;
String[] names; 

Initialization: 

int[] nums = new int[5] -> an arrays of nums whose length is 5.
String[]names = new String[6] -> an array of strings whose length is 6.

for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
  nums[i] = value; 
}

for(int num: nums) {
  System.out.println(num);
}

You can directly assign the value as well. 

int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

nums[0] = 6; --> this would modify the array. 

So new array would be [6, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Note: 

int[] nums = {1, 2} and int[]nums = new int[]{1, 2} both serve the same purpose. 

The first is used when we want to initialize when we declare it, second can be used to create arrays on demand. 

Both are allocated in heap and reference variable nums would be in stack.
