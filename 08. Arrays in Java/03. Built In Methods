int[] nums = {2, 1, 4, 3, 5};

Some of the important methods in Arrays:

nums.length -> would give me the length of array (5)
Arrays.sort(nums) -> sorts the array (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Arrays.binarySearch(nums, value)
Arrays.binarySearch(nums, value, start, end)
Arrays.copyOf(nums, end)
Arrays.copyOf(nums, start, end)
Arrays.fill(nums, value)

Note: Copy Of Method would allow us to truly copy the elements of the array. Simple assignment would cause 
two reference variable pointing to same object. 

int[] nums = {1, 2, 3}
int[] gums = nums;

gums[0] = 4; // this would make nums[0] to 4 as well. 

int[] gums = Arrays.copyOf(nums, nums.length) --> exact copy, not referring to same 
int[] gums = Arrays.copyOf(nums, 2 * nums.length) --> exact copy, initialize with nums and extend the length
int[] gums = Arrays.copyOf(nums, 2) --> exact copy, initialize with nums and reduce the length
int[] gums = Arrays.copyOf(nums, 1, 2) --> exact copy, initialize with nums with first to second index {2, 3} for {1, 2, 3}
