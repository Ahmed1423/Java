A class is a blue print of an object. It defines what data an object should have and the behaviours. 

Syntax:

class ClassName {

  datatype variable_name;

  datatype method_name(..args) {
    //statements
  }
}

ClassName Starts with a capital letter and follows camel case thereafter.

Variables defined with in the class are called instance variables.
Functions defined with in the class are called methods.

These variables and methods together are considered as members of the class.

Class doesn't take any space in memory.
