Strings are a sequence of characters. 

Example: "Khan" 

Declaring a String:

String name; 

Initializing a String:

String name = "Ahmed";

Why Strings when we have char arrays: 

1. Lot of methods.
2. Immutable whereas char arrays are mutable.
3. performance optimizations such as efficient memory management by JVM.
