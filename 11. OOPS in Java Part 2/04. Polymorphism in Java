Polymorphism means ability to exhibit multiple forms. It gives language ability that allows objects to have same name but different
functionality. 

Polymorphism in Java is of two types: 

1) compile time Polymorphism - achieved through method overloading. Also known as static Polymorphism.
2) run time Polymorphism - achieved through method overriding. Also known as dynamic Polymorphism.

Method Overloading -> same method name, difference in no of parameters (or) types. 
Methods overriding -> inheritance, same name and signature. 

Runtime Polymorphism helps us to achieve dynamic method dispatch which is call to a method is resolved at run time based on the 
object rather than the reference variable.
