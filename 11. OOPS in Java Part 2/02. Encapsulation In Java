Encapsulation is the principle which says hide the data and its behaviours into a single corresponding unit. 

In Java, Encapsulation is achieved with the help of class where we declare all the data or properties as private and have getters/setters
to access the data. 

Validation must be done in a proper way before we use the setters. 

This is generally used for preventing unauthorized access and to maintain integrity of the data.
