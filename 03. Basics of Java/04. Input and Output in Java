In Java, you read the input from console(Standard input stream) with the help of Scanner class: 

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

// int 

int number = scanner.nextInt();
String value = scanner.next() (or) scanner.nextLine();
boolean isFalse = scanner.nextBoolean();
float num = scanner.nextFloat();
double pi = scanner.nextDouble();
Byte b = scanner.nextByte();
Short s = scanner.nextShort();
long digit = scanner.nextLong();

// close the scanner so the resources are released

scanner.close();

Note: Garbage collector frees up the memory, but doesn't & cannot close the resources.

In order to write the output, to standard output stream:

- System.out.println("abcde"); // print and cursor moves to new line
- System.out.print("abcde); // print and cursor is at the same line

This is only for reading/writing to console, we have different methods for file handling.
