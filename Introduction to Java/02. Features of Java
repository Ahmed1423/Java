Java is popular and is used world wide because of the following: 

1. Simple: 
Java is simple because of the following: 
- It is based on C++ (Smooth transition for C++ developers to Java)
- Removed complex and rarely used features (pointers, structures, unions and operator overloading)
- No need to remove unreferenced objects as we have automatic garbage collection

2. Object Oriented: 
Object Oriented programming is a methodology where we organize our software around objects that incorporates both data and behaviour.

Six pillars of OOPS: 
- objects
- classes
- abstraction 
- encapsulation 
- inheritance 
- polymorphism 

3. Platform independent:
Java code gets compiled to bytecode which is a machine independent code and can be run on any platform. (linux, windows, MAC)

4. Architecture Neutral:
Java is architecture neutral because it's features are not implementation based. For example, size of the data type int is fixed. 
In C, it is 2 bytes for 32 bit and 4 bytes for 64 bit, but in java it is 4 bytes for 32 and 64 bit.

5. Portable:
Since it is platform independent, it can be carried and executed on any machine. 

6: Robust:
Java is Robust(Strong) because:
- Strong memory management. 
- automatic garbage collection
- exception handling and type checking mechanisms.

7: Secure:
- runs inside a virtual machine sandbox
- bytecode verifier: verifies bytecode for any illegal access. 
- no explicit pointers, so no direct access to memory
- security manager: decides which resources a class can access such as read or write to

8: Dynamic:
- supports method overriding. (call to a method is decided at runtime based on object rather than reference variable)
- classes are loaded at runtime rather than start of the program. 

9. Multithreaded:
Java supports multithreading that helps us to execute tasks concurrently. 

10. distributed:
Java is distributed because it has inbuilt tools & software that makes it easy for us to create distributed applications. 
- RMI -> allows objects on different machines to communicate
- supports network communication such as socket communication, http etc with java.net package
- interact with database (MySQL, Oracle) with the help of JDBC
